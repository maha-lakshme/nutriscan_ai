## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nutriscan_ai.git
    cd nutriscan_ai
    ```
2.  **Ensure you have Flutter SDK installed.** If not, follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  **Set up Firebase (for Google ML Kit):**
    *   Follow the instructions to add Firebase to your Flutter app: [Add Firebase to your Flutter app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)
    *   Ensure you have the necessary configuration files (e.g., `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS) in your project.
    *   For ML Kit on Android, ensure the following dependency is added to your `android/app/build.gradle` if not already present by the plugin:
        ```gradle
        dependencies {
            // ... other dependencies
            implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-mlkit-text-recognition:18.0.0' // Or the latest version
        }
        ```
    *   For ML Kit on iOS, you might need to update your `Podfile`.
5.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

    *Note: Ensure you have a connected device or a running emulator/simulator.*
